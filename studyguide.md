# CIS 2650 Exam I Study Guide 

## Terms Under Multiple Choice

### Immutable Objects (Page: 63)
- An object that cannot be modified directly 
	- No appending, extending or inserting methods
- Examples: Tuples are immutable objects 

### Tuples (Page: 62)
- Similar to lists (ordered sets of items)
- Differences between the two are....
	- Syntax: by parenthesis or just commmas  
		- tuple = ('a', 'b', b) or tuple = 'a', 'b', 'c'
	- Tuples are IMMUTABLE while lists are MUTABLE 
		- Tuples cannot be directly deleted or altered

### ASCII Codes (Page: 79)
- Pronounced 'Askee'
- Values that correspond with characters on keyboard
- Example:
	- 'A' = ASCII value of 65
	- 'b' = ASCII value of 98

### If Statements (Page: 91)
- 'True false' statement of programming

### Loop Control: The Break Statement (Page 108)
- Immediately terminates loop 
- Can exist anywhere in the body of a loop 

### Loop Control: The Continue Statement (Pages: 108-109)
- "When the continue statementins executed within the body of a loop, the current iteration of the loop terminates and execution returns to loop's header"
- These are typically used in **if** statements

### Variable Scopes (Page: 152-153) 
- Local scope: when a variable only exists inside 1 given function
- Global scope: when a variable can be recognized anywhere in the program 

### Function Reusability (Page 184?)
- When a function can be reused multiple times in the same program 
- When using def title(): instead of writing code over and over again 

### Python Sets (Page: 198)
- An unordered collection of unique elements with no duplicates. 
- Much like a list but unordered
- Sets do not have any 'order' method
- Set up with {} instead of []
- Sets cannot contain lists or other sets
- Stes have no order
- Sets Cannot be indexed
- Sets Can't use methods such as 'sort' and 'reverse'
- Duplicate elements in set will be deleted

### Python Object Oriented Programming (Page: 185)
- Object: an encapsulation  of data and code that operates on the data. A collection of cooperating objects 
- Programming around "objects"
- [Helpful Link](https://pythonschool.net/oop/introduction-to-object-oriented-programming/)
	- Characteristic == Attributes 
	- Behaviors == Methods 

### Using Class Objects 
- Self explainitory 

### Inheritance Encapsulation Polymorphism 
- Basic concepts of OOP
	- **Abstraction**: Simplifying a complex reality by modeling classes appropriate to the problem.
	- **Polymorphism**: The process of using an operator or function in different ways for different data input 
	- **Encapsulation**: Hiding the implementation details of a class from other objects 
	- **Inheritance**: A way to form new classes using already-defined-classes
